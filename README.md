Data analysis for paper title, "Counter-gradient variation in gene expression between fish populations facilitates colonization of low-dissolved oxygen environments", DOI: doi.org/10.1111/mec.17419. Scripts use raw RNA-seq data to assemble de novo transcriptome assemblies that are then used to analyze shifts in gene expression in two species of fish that live in low- or high-DO environments. Scripts should be run in order of numbering. Raw RNA-seq data can be downloaded from SRA (accession numbers found in paper).
